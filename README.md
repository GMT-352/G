## One Requirement, One Map on SDG #11

## Project Title
Safe assembly areas after the February 6 earthquake in Hatay

## A Case Study (Region of Interests)
Mitigating effects of the 6 February earthquake.
## Aim and Objectives 
__Aim of Project:__  The aim of this project is detection of areas such as parks and school gardens in Hatay due to unsafe areas brought about by the February 6 earthquake.

__Objectives of the project:__ 
- Detection of safe zones ( school gardens and parking areas) that have decreased after the earthquake and whose exact locations are unknown.
- With the availability of safe areas, people are directed to these areas.
-The easing of the effects of the earthquake thanks to the ability of people to reach safe areas.

## Requirements
- To access the necessary data for the identification of safe areas through the open street map and to examine their distance to the earthquake-affected areas.
- After accessing the data, to process the data with a GIS software tool (for example: Qgis). 
- Determination of these areas after the safe areas have been finalized.
- Provision of equipment to the areas to meet the needs of earthquake victims.

## Data
- Open Street Map
